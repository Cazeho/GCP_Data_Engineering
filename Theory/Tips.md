## Tips for the exam

- know each specs for a GCP component & vice versa
- be able to choose by the functionality (see this [table](https://github.com/obrunet/GCP_Data_Engineering/blob/main/Theory/Components.md#classification)) 
- determine the purpose of the use case presented in the question
- know the difference between GCP components & their open source / hadoop counterparts
- be aware how to migrate datawarehouse, on premise clusters...
- know the basics of Tensorflow, Stackdriver, Data Fusion & Data Studio, the regulations...
- practice - see [the sample questions](https://cloud.google.com/certification/sample-questions/data-engineer) to get familiar with the exam
- keep in mind all the best practices, the anti/pattern for each component
- acquire a strong knowledge in NoSql databases & in Machine Learning
- beware there could be multiple answers
- know when answers are wrong and try to eliminate them



### Exam question topics:
- Storage (20%),
- Big Data Processing (35%),
- Machine Learning (18%),
- case studies (same as sample case studies 15%) and
- others (Hadoop, security, stackdriver about 12%).

or more precisely (dated back mid 2019, since then redis, airflow & RGPD topics have been added) :


GCP Service | Service Function | Certification weight 
--------|-------------|-------------|
Cloud Storage | Unified object storage | 2 % |
Cloud SQL & Spanner | Fully-managed SQL Database | 4 % | 
Cloud Datastore | NoSQL database (think adhoc storage) | 2 % | 
Big Table | NoSQL massive data big data service | 16 % | 
Big Query | Petabyte scale data warehouse | 16 % | 
Pub/Sub | Asynchronous messaging service | 6 % | 
Cloud Dataproc | Managed hadoop and spark | 12 % | 
Cloud Dataflow | Data Processing (Pipelines) | 16 % | 
Tensorflow | Machine learning language | 20 % | 
** La certification a été mise à jour en avril 2019 en ajoutant redis et airflow managé + RGPD
