# GCP Data Engineering
A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. A Data Engineer should be able to design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on security and compliance; scalability and efficiency; reliability and fidelity; and flexibility and portability. A Data Engineer should also be able to leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

The GCP Professional Data Engineer exam assesses your ability to:
- Design data processing systems
- Build and operationalize data processing systems
- Operationalize machine learning models
- Ensure solution quality

# Introduction
In the __Theory__ chapter are presented my personnal notes that summerize everything one need to know in order to get prepared for this exam/certification.
Then in the __Practice__ section, you'll find all the capstone projects i've accomplished to master the different GCP components.
